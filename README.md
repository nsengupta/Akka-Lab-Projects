An empty project, that resolves dependencies and sets up the working stack for the training that I provide


* Download using _git_: git clone TrainingInstallationChecker-Akka
* Change your working directory to _TrainingInstallationChecker-Akka_
* At the command prompt,fire: sbt compile
* If _sbt_ is installed (and PATH points to it), then it will use that; otherwise, a _sbt_ binary will be installed automatically.
* A number of dependencies will be resolved. Make sure to keep the machine connected.
